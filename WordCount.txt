It’s a good time to be a fan of Superman. And after the last few months (closer to a year), those fond of the comic book Man of Steel needed a bit of a boost. While a resounding success, the launch of the DC “Rebirth” saw the Big Blue Boy scout himself not reinvigorated, like his colleagues, but outright replaced. The New 52 Superman died under somewhat mysterious circumstances, and the Superman of old – and of older comic book fans – returned to the DC Universe, wife Lois Lane and son Jonathan Kent behind him. But things have changed.

The mystery and uncertainty surrounding this new Superman and the lingering question of the New 52 Superman’s fate were there from the start, and in Action Comics #976, the twist has finally been delivered. The previous issue’s tease was everything it seemed: the New 52 Superman is back, having never died at all. But to make sure every fan of DC’s biggest hero leaves happy, the “Superman Reborn” story sees the younger, New 52 version and the older father and husband folded into one.
